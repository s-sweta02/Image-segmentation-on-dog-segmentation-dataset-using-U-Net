# Image-segmentation-on-dog-segmentation-dataset-using-U-Net
In this work, Unet is used to segment the images of dog. The base code doesn't use data augmentation. The model is trained using model.fit() for 20 epochs. For the improvised code, the code uses data augmentation for image rotation, zoomed etc. The image and mask generator are combined and trained using model.fit().
