# Image-segmentation-on-dog-segmentation-dataset-using-U-Net
In this work, Unet is used to segment the images of dog. The base code doesn't use data augmentation. The model is trained using model.fit() for 20 epochs. For the improvised code, the code uses data augmentation for image rotation, zoomed etc. The image and mask generator are combined and trained using model.fit().  It uses 25 epochs to run the code.
The model's performance was assessed using loss and accuracy metrics, where the base code achieved an accuracy of 0.7850 with a loss of 0.4401, while the improved version attained a slightly higher accuracy of 0.7913 and a reduced loss of 0.4232.
